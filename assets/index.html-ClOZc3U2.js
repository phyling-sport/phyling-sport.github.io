The data can be viewed and processed directly in our application; they can also be exported in csv format for further analysis.</p><p><img src="'+r+'" alt="presentation"></p><h2 id="quick-start" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#quick-start"><span>Quick start</span></a></h2><p>The <strong>Mini-Phyling</strong> used alone or with a force sensor are already preconfigured.

Once the recording is complete, the data is processed with specific analysis modules and can be visualized.
